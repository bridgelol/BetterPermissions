# BetterPermissions
Utility made to reduce the load for setting/updating player permissions in bukkit.

## What exactly does this utility change?
BetterPermissions changes the fact that bukkit "recalculates" permissions everytime a permission is set on an attachment,
causing major performance issues. This can provide an overall way better experience updating player's permissions.
